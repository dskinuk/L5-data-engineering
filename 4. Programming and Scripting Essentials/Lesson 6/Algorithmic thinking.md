# Algorithmic thinking

## Introduction
### Popular algorithms - Retail
- browsing history insights - Analysis of what you have clicked, searched and lingered on and take actions based on this data
- Collaborative filetring - "Customers who bought this also bought" - recommendations
- Content based filtering - filters based on preferences
- Matrix factorisation - break down preferences and predict what you might like
### for Search engines
- Page ranking
- efficient retrieval
### Social netwrok
- graph algorithms
- friend suggestions

### Example

#### Sorting
  - Bubble sort
  - Quick Sort
  - merge Sort

### Process
- Break the problem down
- Think of possible solutions
- develop solution code

## SW development tools and techniques
- COllaborative software
- SW development tools
- version control
- debugging techniques
- testing practices
- Documentation

## Building alorithms
- Time efficiency
- Space (memory) efficiency
- Optimum resource use

## Advanced algorithmic techniques
- Shortest path algo - used in GPS
- Cycle detection - These algorithms help us identify cycles in a graph, preventing us from going in circles.
- NW Flow algo - ??
- String algo
    - pattern matching
    - sub string search
    - string compression
 
### Advanced Data structures
  - heaps (priority queues) - help us maintain a partially ordered structure, are useful for tasks like scheduling.
  - Tries (prefix trees) - help us store words in a tree-like structure for efficient word lookup, like a dictionary organised in a way that allows fast word search
  - Segment trees (interval trees) - help us handle range queries efficiently. They divide data into segments, allowing quick calculations (e.g., finding maximum or sum) within specific intervals and are essential for handling dynamic data.
