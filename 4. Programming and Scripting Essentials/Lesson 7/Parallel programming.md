# Parallel Programming

## Intro - key concepts
- Concurrency
- Threads Vs Processes
- Distributed computing
## performance and deployment considerations
- Latency
    - Data Locality
    - Load balancing
- Benefits of Spark
   - Spped
   - ease of use
   - flexibility
   - scalability

## Parallilism and concurrency
Both mean happening at the same time however in data eng
- COncurrency - interruptibility
You bring your laptop to the passport office and work on the presentation while waiting. 
This way, you only need an extra hour at home instead of 5. Here, you interrupt one task to work on the other, using their interruptibility.

- Parallelism - Independability
You assign the presentation task to an assistant while you handle the passport task. Both tasks are done independently by different people, showcasing independability.
