# Data Quality Management

## Introduction to Data Quality

Data Quality is the foundation of a strong and resilient data driven enterprise
It encompasses some key dimensiosn or metrics and they are abbreviated as :
**CIAT**

-- **C** - **Consistency** - How well does the data conform to standards(Uniformity)
  
-- **I** - **Integrity** - How you can ensure that remains accurate and consistent throughout the lifecycle (Completeness)

-- **A** - **Accuracy** - How well does the data represent the real world(correctness, validity)

-- **T** - **Timeliness** - How uptodate is the data(recency) 

Over a period of time another high level metric can be used ***RELIABILITY***
Which measures how dependable and trustworthy the data is?

## Data and Meta Data Standards   

Like a map enables people travelling by different modes in different geographic locations to travel and reach their destinations, the standards ensure that data across multiple systems stays aligned and can interact between varied systems and toolsets.

**Open standards** - They are used by multiple engineers across various use cases and they can contribute to them as well to ensure that:

  - ***Compatibility*** - Different systems and tools can talk to each other
  
  - ***Flexibility*** - Are free to use varied products and toolsets from different companies
  
  - ***Innovation*** - Encourages new ideas by allowing everyone to contribute to these standards
  
  - ***Cost effective*** - Often free to use and thus save costs to companies

Thus fosters a collaborative environment for engineeers to innovate cost effective tools for data management that can be 
seamlessly integrated and evolved. 

### Some examples of Open standards are:

- Industry specific - (HL7 for health care industry)
- Cross Industry - (HTTPS/TCPIP)
- Open data standards (ODATA, OPEN API)

Some standards used in the bank:

- ISO20022
- FIX - the language of the global financial markets used extensively by buy and sell-side firms, trading platforms and even regulators to communicate 

**Fair Standard**

Fair data are data that meet:
- ***Findability*** - Data can be easily found by authorised users. Cataloging data and assigning unique identifiers
- ***Accessibilty*** - Access management to ensure the right people have the right access to the data at all times
- ***Interoperability*** - Ensure data can be integrated across systems. Ensure uniform formats and adoption of common standards across the board.
- ***Reusability*** - Ensure the metadata for the data is accurate and available across systems so that the data can be re-used without having to re-collect and create inconsistencies.
