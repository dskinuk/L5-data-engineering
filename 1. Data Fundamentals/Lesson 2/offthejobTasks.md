- The datasets are related to Health facilities from 3 different regions
- The format of the data in all the 3 regions is different in terms of
    - Columns ( Some have an id some dont)
    - Data types (Id is nmeric in some and alphanumeric in some)
    - Order of the data (columns arent ordererd in the same way in all 3 sets)
    - Column data is spread over multiple merged cells
 
- While consolidating the data sets
    - The formatting has been made consistent
    -  The columns that arent consistent across all data sets have been dropped
    -  A meta data section has been created to provide information of the columns
