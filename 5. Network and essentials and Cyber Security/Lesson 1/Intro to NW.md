# Introduction to Netwrking

## OCI refrence model
  - Application Layer - human interaction layer where apps can access the NW
  - Presentation Layer - ensures data is in usable format. encryption occurs here
  - Session Layer - Maintains connections and responsible for ports
  - Transport Layer - Transmits data
  - NW layer - decides which path the data will take
  - Data Link Layer - defines the format of the data on the NW
  - Physical Layer - Transmits raw data in bit stream

TCP/IP - Transmission COntrol Protocol/Internet Protocol - Backbone of the internet that allows devices to connect and communicate.

- How does TCP work
  - Breaks the data into smaller packets
  - Numbers the data along with the sequence in which it should be arranged at the receiving end
  - Sends and gets a confirmation
- How does IP work
  - every computer has a unique address
  - IP ensures the fastest route to the address to send the packets
