## Impacts of upstream data modelling on downstream experience

    - D - Delete

## Importance of Good Data Modelling

  - Logical Data Model
    - Data Types
    - Normalisation
  - Physical Data Model
    - Primary and Foreign Keys
    - Views
    - Indexes
  - ACID - Atomicity, COnsistency, Isolation, Durability
    

## ACID and the importance of transacions

## Nested SQL queries 

## Joins and Data Normalisation

## Group By
