# Schemas and Integration

## Relational Data Model

1. STructure - Table including rows and columns
2. Query Language - SQL - Structured Query Language
3. Constraints on the data - i.e. Not NULL, Primary key etc.

## Keys

1. Primary Keys - Unique identifier for records in a table.

2. Foreign Keys - attributes that allow to relate current table to another table by matching the primary key.

They play a pivotal role in maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between data tables.
